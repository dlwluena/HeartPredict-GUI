An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based medical support tool that predicts heart disease risk using deep learning.

## Features
- **ANN Architecture:** Multi-Layer Perceptron built with Keras/TensorFlow.
- **Optimization:** Improved using L2 Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning.
- **Modern GUI:** Interactive medical dashboard built with PySide6.
- **Accuracy:** 90% test performance on the UCI Cleveland dataset.

## Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
- PySide6 (GUI Framework)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the training (optional): `jupyter notebook main.ipynb`
3. Launch the App: `python gui.py`
